# CIS1566_Second_Program
simple while loop guessing game
This program generates a random variable within the range 1 to 100. This sets the game's winning value.
It then sets a starting value for the number of tries the player begins the game with and reduces each
time the player enters a number that isn't the winning value. There is also a counter that increments each time the
player enters a number that isn't the winning value as long as they are not out of tries. The player is then asked to
guess a number, with error checking for non-numeric values. If the player guesses the randomly generated value then
a congratulations message is printed and the loop breaks. If the player does not guess correctly, the number of tries
decreases with each incorrect guess until zero at which point a lost message is printed and the loop breaks.
